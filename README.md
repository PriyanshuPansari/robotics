# RoboSim: A Custom Robotics Framework

## Overview
RoboSim is a from-scratch robotics simulation and algorithm development framework designed for learning and implementing fundamental robotics concepts without relying on existing platforms like ROS or Gazebo. This project aims to provide deep insights into robotics principles through hands-on implementation of core algorithms and simulation components.

## Project Goals
- Build a complete robotics simulation environment from the ground up
- Implement and visualize core robotics algorithms
- Create a modular framework that can interface with hardware in future phases
- Provide a comprehensive learning platform for robotics fundamentals

## Features

### Simulation Environment
- Custom physics engine for rigid body dynamics
- 3D visualization system with real-time rendering
- Configurable robot models and sensor simulation
- Environment builder for creating test scenarios
- Time control for accelerated or slowed simulation

### Core Robotics Algorithms
- Forward and inverse kinematics
- Path planning (A*, RRT, potential fields)
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- PID and advanced controllers
- Sensor fusion and state estimation

### Architecture
The framework follows a modular design with the following components:
- **Core Engine**: Physics simulation, time management, and event system
- **Robot Models**: Kinematics, dynamics, and control interfaces
- **Sensors**: Virtual sensors with configurable noise models
- **Algorithm Library**: Implementation of common robotics algorithms
- **Visualization**: 3D rendering and data visualization tools

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++23 compiler (GCC 13+, Clang 17+, or MSVC 2022+)
- Nix package manager
- Basic understanding of linear algebra and control theory

### Installation with Nix

This project uses Nix to provide a consistent development environment with all necessary dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robosim.git
cd robosim
